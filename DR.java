 //            More about Me
 /* I would really love to become a staff member.
  * Maybe not particularly a Developer, maybe staff management, or something!
  * Yes I know a lot about java, but I relize that theres already 3/4 developers. So please consider me
  * for another role. I have ran 3 servers in past, one in particular is a OP-Prison owned by me, and friend. We had over 130+ players online and the 
  * server was called "InfernoPrison" Check it out, it was pretty big! Thank you for your time! You can find me on TS!
